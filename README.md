FROGGER!
  Here is an attempt at re-creating a classic video game from the #80's for nostalgic purposes! Like so many others, I spent long periods of time playing this game which was simple in theory but presented many challenges.
  Frogger, is simply trying to get back to his Lily pad home which lies across a stretch of busy highway and a body of water. The goal is to maneuver him safely back home without getting hit by a car (!). Once you've crossed the highway, Frogger's home awaits across a river.  Hop across floating logs, and turtles, but make haste in doing so, because even though our main character is an amphibian, he will lose his life and you will lose the game should you let him drop into the water. 
The rules of this game are simple: do not let the frogger perish in either of these environments.  Avoid contact with any moving object other than a turtle that is not submerged in water.  You get three lives (frogs). Every step forward is 10 points. Every frog that makes it to a lily pad is 50 points and if the player achieves total sucess of getting all three frogs across they are awarded 100points.
