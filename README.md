# FROGGER
  Here is an attempt at re-creating a classic video game from the #80's for nostalgic purposes! Like so many others, I spent long periods of time playing this game which was simple in theory but presented a few challenges.
  Frogger, is simply trying to get back to his Lily pad home which lies across a stretch of busy highway and a body of water. The goal is to maneuver him safely back home without getting hit by a car (!). Once you've crossed the highway, Frogger's home awaits across a river.  Hop across floating logs, but make haste in doing so, because even though our main character is an amphibian, he will lose his life and you will lose the game should you let him drop into the water. Every turn is 50 seconds or its automatic game over and you lose.
 It is a one player game against the computer in that the cars and logs and turtles will be constantly flowing across the screen.
The user will hit the arrow keys to maneuver Frogger across the game board.
The game will signal a win when lilypads are reached, and will signal a loss if they get hit by an obstacle or fall in the water.


## Tech Stack: 
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript with DOM events

 ## MVP 
* Render a game board with different moving obstacles (cars, etc)
* Set the board up so if the frog is hit or falls in the water, he dies and the game is over.
* Set the winning conditions to crossing the board to the lily pads.
* Create a game refresh button without reloading entire page/

## Stretch Goals
* If user wins, speed up moving car intervals for next round.
* Attempt using canvas to add aesthetics to the board.
* Add audio to increase engagement.

## Potential Roadblocks 
* Looping the motion of moving obstacles on the board correctly.
* Collision detection algorithm. 

## Post Project Reflection
* Keep things as simple as possible and make a list of needed functionality is the best practice.  I started over and had to simplify.
